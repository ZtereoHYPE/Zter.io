# Zter.io
This is an attempt to ~~copy~~ remake the game Agar.io in node.js and P5.js.

## Small note:
At this point this project is close to be completed. The repo will be left open just in case someone wants to take a look, contribute, or i want to change something but this was just supposed to be a small rushed minigame and it is currently in a stable-ish state.

## How to start/play:
If the project is up and running you should be able to find it at io.ztereohype.codes (not yet). Else, you can always download it and execute it with `node server_manager.js`

## TODOs
- Make an UI where players can connect and choose name and where they end up when dying.

## TODON'Ts
- Splitting and merging. Don't even think of that nightmare. (I do accept contributions though)

## Contributions
i dont see why you should contribute to this honestly lol the code is a mess

# Zter.io
This is an attempt to ~~copy~~ remake the game Agar.io in node.js and P5.js.

## TODOs
- Make the colours be assigned based on the ID and make players have a name.
- Make an UI where players can connect and choose name and where they end up when dying.

## TODON'Ts
- Splitting and merging. Don't even think of that nightmare. (I do accept contributions though)

## Contributions
i dont see why you should contribute to this honestly lol the code is a mess
